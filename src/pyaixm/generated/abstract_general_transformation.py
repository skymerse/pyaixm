class AbstractGeneralTransformation(AbstractGeneralTransformationType):
    """Gml:AbstractGeneralTransformation is an abstract operation on coordinates
    that usually includes a change of Datum.

    The parameters of a coordinate transformation are empirically derived from data containing the coordinates of a series of points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process is usually "over-determined", allowing derivation of error (or accuracy) estimates for the transformation. Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result in multiple (different) versions of the same coordinate transformation. The operationVersion, sourceCRS, and targetCRS proeprty elements are mandatory in a coordinate transformation.
    This abstract complex type is expected to be extended for well-known operation methods with many Transformation instances, in Application Schemas that define operation-method-specialized value element names and contents. This transformation uses an operation method with associated parameter values. However, operation methods and parameter values are directly associated with concrete subtypes, not with this abstract type. All concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include a "usesMethod" element that references one "OperationMethod" element. Similarly, all concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include one or more elements each named "uses...Value" that each use the type of an element substitutable for the "AbstractGeneralParameterValue" element.
